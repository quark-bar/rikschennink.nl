Yesterday I presented ConditionerJS during at an NLHTML5 meetup hosted by Booking.com. Excellent venue, very kind attendees, interesting questions and ideas on how to use ConditionerJS with React or Redux.

The talk has been recorded and should be up soon on the [NLHTML5 YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/nlhtml5).
