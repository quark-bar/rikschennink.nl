Yesterday I presented ConditionerJS at a Fronteers meetup organized by Kabisa. This is a short post to reference the slides, resources and video. 

The talk has been recorded and I'll put up the video as soon as it becomes available (it's in Dutch by the way). The link list below features related information.
