A couple of days ago I posted a [tweet about us developers dropping accessibility in favour of Internet Explorer 8 support](https://twitter.com/rikschennink/status/520521059884617728). A lot of people wanted to know what information I based my statement on. Starting to doubt myself I wrote this article to back it up.

I’ve taken the liberty to collect some usage statistics and do some research on accessibility in The Netherlands. My comparison  is below. It’s not super in depth and it’s not complete, but even these couple numbers paint a clear picture.


## Browser usage

I’ve used [Global StatCounter Data](http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-browser_version_partially_combined-ww-monthly-201410-201410-bar) as my source. They analyse data from 15 billion page views each month across the globe.	

Globally, 5% of all desktop users are on Internet Explorer 8. If I add mobile, tablet and console data, this further lowers to 3%.

In [Europe](http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-browser_version_partially_combined-eu-monthly-201410-201410-bar) the desktop share for Internet Explorer 8 is at approximately 2%. In [North America](http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-browser_version_partially_combined-na-monthly-201410-201410-bar) the percentage is a lot higher at nearly 9%. The percentages for [Asia](http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-browser_version_partially_combined-as-monthly-201410-201410-bar) are comparable to Europe.

Now let’s compare these numbers to statistics on people with disabilities.


## Disability stats

I’ve been collecting some accessibility related numbers from The Netherlands. I assume, which I know is dangerous, that these numbers might be somewhat the same around the globe. Note that my sources are in Dutch, I expect some translation service will able to help you out.


### Vision

Data points out that [approximately 700,000 people in The Netherlands are color blind](http://mens-en-gezondheid.infonu.nl/aandoeningen/57345-kleurenblindheid-is-soms-levensgevaarlijk.html) to various degrees. This is 4% of the Dutch population.

On top of this there are [320,000 people which suffer a serious vision impairment](http://www.visio.org/nl-nl/visuele-beperking) (45.000 of those are blind). This group makes up approximately 2% of the population.

Imagine yourself presenting visuals on an old beamer or trying to browse the web on a sunny beach. If you’ve got 20/20 vision accessible color contrast will still benefit you.


### Motor

The Dutch Labour Inspectorate estimates [approximately 50% of people working in front of a display suffer from Repetitive Strain Injury](http://mens-en-gezondheid.infonu.nl/aandoeningen/63020-rsi-wat-is-dat-eigenlijk.html). More conservative numbers point to 19%. With 2.5 million people working with computers daily that translates to some 3% of the population.

You might break your arm or dislocate your shoulder. Browsing the web with your non-preferred hand will most certainly make interacting with small click areas or doing gesture based input troublesome.


### Cognitive

[1.3 million people in the Netherlands have low literacy skills](http://www.lezenenschrijven.nl/over/veelgestelde-vragen#hoeveel-mensen-in-nederland-zijn-laaggeletterd). They find it difficult to understand information if it’s not written out in a simple down to earth manner. That’s 8% of the population.

If you are planning to move to another country or have to request overseas information it would be nice if this information was easy to understand, even for non natives.


## Conclusion

We cannot simply add these percentages together because there’s probably some overlap in them. Also, these are just a couple of disabilities, there are way more, but I feel these numbers are enough to drive the point home.

I think if we’re honest we can conclude that the total amount will be above the Internet Explorer 8 usage percentage, most certainly in The Netherlands but also in The United States and a lot of countries around the world.

That was not the point of the tweet though. In the end it’s not about favouring accessibility over Internet Explorer 8. If you follow a smart progressive enhancement strategy and educate your client about the web you will be able to do both.

The original tweet was about awareness.

When we talk about browser support, we are all very serious about usage percentages, ready to drop support when it falls below a certain level. But putting those percentages on groups of disabled users would be wrong and creates room to drop user groups. With the data above we could decide to build in support for people with cognitive problems and ignore those who are color blind, or fully blind for that matter. That cannot be the way forward.

A lot of these people have got a though enough time already, by making it easy for them to access information you’re brightening their day and helping your future self in the process. If that isn’t a good thing then I don’t know what is.
