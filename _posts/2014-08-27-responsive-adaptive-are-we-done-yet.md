There's confusion on the streets about what responsive and adaptive actually mean. I notice this among colleagues but also, unsurprisingly, among clients, they must be in a serious world of hurt. The fun thing is, we've sowed this confusion ourself by coining these cool terms. I feel these terms have served their purpose and it's now time to move one.

There was a time, a simple time, when we had the internet with its back against the wall serving our every request at 1024 pixels per second. Then, media queries, responsive, adaptive, all-the-things-first, great stuff, it helped us focus on developing for the "new" web. I've put that in quotes as the web itself didn't really change.

I did my research on responsive and adaptive, but had to pull the plug because I started bleeding profusely from the eyes and ears. Okay, listen, apparently responsive can live on it's own but is also a subset of adaptive, but wait, things key to the fixed adaptive way of life contradict core concepts in the responsive flex camp. If it's a subset, it's a really awkward one, come to think of it, I find the word awkward to be pretty awkward as well.

I ask you, it's the year 2014, what does the word **website** mean standing on its own?

1. A fixed width, 1024 pixels, mouse input, desktop site.

2. A site suitable to be read and interacted with pleasantly across a myriad of devices.

I'm not going to answer that for you.

To me **responsive website** and **adaptive website** feel like a subset of **website**. If you're selling a responsive website you're actually selling something that is less of a website than it should be. You're creating room for excuses making it possible to say: "well we don't have to do this, because that's not part of the responsive way of life". The same goes for adaptive.

Let's stop this now, the web is everywhere, websites are everywhere, read everywhere, just build 'm to work everywhere. If we do that there's no need for confusion, semantic games or more hipster terms.
