# Hi!

It’s me, Rik! 

A creative front-end engineer occupying this 2D plane people call The Netherlands. While we don’t have any serious mountains around here we do have a thriving and adventurous web industry. 

I like to think about where the web is heading and often [tweet](http://twitter.com/rikschennink) about this. When my thoughts don’t fit in 140 characters I like to [write them down](http://rikschennink.nl/thoughts/). I’ve written for [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/rik-schennink/) and hope to be contributing some more articles in the near future.

I experiment with CSS and JavaScript, and like to post results to [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/rikschennink) and [CodePen](http://codepen.io/rikschennink/). I have some [active repositories](https://github.com/rikschennink) on GitHub and sell web components on [CodeCanyon](http://codecanyon.net/user/rikschennink/portfolio?WT.ac=portfolio_item&WT.z_author=rikschennink). 

Building my own products and helping people setup their own ventures is fantastic, it really highlights the openness of the web and shows how people are using it around the globe.

With the device landscape exploding around us, the web, and with it the industry, will evolve and change beyond our wildest expectations. To be in the middle of that is amazing.
